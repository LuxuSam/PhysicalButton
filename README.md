# üéõ Physical Button üéõ

The PhysicalButton Plugin (hence the name) lets you add physical buttons to your Raspberry Pi.
The buttons are then able to send GCODE or actions to your printer.

## Setup
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/LuxuSam/PhysicalButton/archive/master.zip

The Buttons have to be plugged in to a ground pin and the desired GPIO Pin that you want to use.
The GPIO must be chosen in BCM mode (see <https://pinout.xyz/>).
If you have other plugins installed that use GPIOs, make sure those plugins are also set to BCM mode.

## üîß Configuration üîß
To add a new button you have to click on the ‚ûï. This adds a new button to the end of your list.

From there you should enter a button name, the used GPIO and the mode (NO or NC) of the button.
In addition you have to specify for how long a button has to be held in order to trigger.

The last step is to add activities to your button which are executed in order of the activities list.
You can edit, move or remove activities in the right pane.

### Note:
You can only configure one button per GPIO.
If you want more activities to be activated upon button press (/release), add more activities to the button.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Use at your own risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
I am not accountable for any damages made to your printer/raspberry pi when using this plugin (e.g. wrong wiring
of buttons, GCODE commands that you send with the buttons to your printer, ...).

When setting the plugin up corresponding to my instructions, nothing should happen.
