# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpretated as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  #octoprint:
  #- 1.2.0

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

  os:
  - linux
  - windows
  - macos
  - freebsd

  # Compatible Python version
  #
  # Plugins should aim for compatibility for Python 2 and 3 for now, in which case the value should be ">=2.7,<4".
  #
  # Plugins that only wish to support Python 3 should set it to ">=3,<4".
  #
  # If your plugin only supports Python 2 (worst case, not recommended for newly developed plugins since Python 2
  # is EOL), leave at ">=2.7,<3" - be aware that your plugin will not be allowed to register on the
  # plugin repository if it only support Python 2.

  python: ">=2.7,<4"

# üéõ Physical Button üéõ

The PhysicalButton Plugin (hence the name) lets you add physical buttons to your Raspberry Pi.
The buttons are then able to send GCODE or actions to your printer.

* **Button Name**
  * This is where you put the name of your button to differentiate them in the list of buttons
* **GPIO**
  * This is the gpio you connect your button to, the other cable has to be connected to a ground pin (Buttons are configured to use internal pulled-up resistors)
* **Mode**
  * Depending on your button setup you have to choose between the two modes  
  * Normally Open (NO)
    * Use this mode if your button is normally not pressed (open)
  * Normally Closed (NC)
    * Use this mode if your button is normally pressed (closed)
* **Debounce Time / Time until active**
  * This is where you set the debounce time for your button if you want the button to react immedieatly on press
  * or when you the button to activate after having pressed the button for the inputed amount of time
* **Choose an activity for your button**
  * Action:

  * Gcode:
    * You can input any GCODE
